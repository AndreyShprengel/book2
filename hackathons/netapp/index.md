# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

## What is the problem?
The systems seem is not reporting every 24 hours as expected, therefore leaving 
only some of the data usefull.

## Why is the problem importnat?
Becuase it makes it difficult to anylize the produce use and preformance and therefore
make changes to the procuct

## What dataset has been made available?
The writes and timestamps from certain systmes

## What specific questions are being raised?
What data is usefull?

# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

## (How was the system expected to proeform? SHould it be reporting everyday at a certian time?)
Answer: Should be reporting at a certian every day?
## (What would you consider good and bad data)
TBD, most of the day probably or 2 days would be ok. 
## (What time of the day is most of the data from when its partail days)
We will have to look at the data

# Approach

Based on the information you've obtained during the Q/A session, come up with
plan how your team will tackle this problem.

## How should the dataset be imported into Tableau?
CSV

## How should the work be distributed among the team members?
Group to discuss questions than tackle them individuals

## What types of charts or visualizations to use to support the answer?
Bar charts, box and whiskers plots, pie charts

## What questions may be too complex for Tableau and may require custom scripts to be written?
Many of the questions probably should be done with custom scrpts becuase of the size of the data and the range.
